This section provides an overview of Cumulus VX and lists the supported environments.

## Cumulus VX

Cumulus VX is a virtual appliance that helps you become familiar with Cumulus Networks technology, and provides a platform for you to prototype network operations and develop custom applications before you deploy into a production environment. Without the need for a bare metal switch or specialized hardware, Cumulus VX runs on all popular hypervisors, making traditional networking protocols such as BGP and MLAG, Cumulus Networks-specific technologies such as ONIE, and Prescriptive Topology Manager (PTM) available for testing and configuration.

Cumulus VX is a virtual machine (VM) on a standard x86 environment. The VM is the same Cumulus Linux operating system supported on NVIDIA ethernet switches. Cumulus VX contains all of the software features as Cumulus Linux but provided in a VM format. Cumulus VX provides full data plane functionality via the Linux kernel as well as layer 2 VLANs and both VXLAN bridging and VXLAN routing capabilities.

{{%notice note%}}
Cumulus VX is designed for testing and not data plane performance. Cumulus VX is not intended to act as a cloud virtual router. No testing or integration has been done with software packet acceleration integrations like SR-IOV or DPDK.

## Cumulus in the Cloud

As an alternative to Cumulus VX, which requires a hypervisor (or hypervisor and orchestrator), you can use
{{<exlink url="https://cumulusnetworks.com/products/cumulus-in-the-cloud/" text="Cumulus in the Cloud">}}, which is a free, personal, virtual data center network that provides a low-effort way to see Cumulus Networks technology in action. Your virtual data center consists of two racks with two dual-homed servers connected with a leaf-spine network. This is a good way to try out Cumulus Linux if you have platform or disk limitations.

## Supported Hypervisors

Cumulus VX is supported on:

- KVM-QEMU
- KVM-QEMU and Vagrant
- VirtualBox
- VirtualBox and GNS3
- VirtualBox and Vagrant
- VMware Fusion, Worksation, and vSphere ESXi

{{%notice note%}}

Although Cumulus VX is supported on VMware Fusion, Workstation, and vSphere ESXi. This document provides setup instructions for VMware vSphere ESXi only.

## Cumulus VX Compared with Cumulus Linux

The VM is the same Cumulus Linux operating system supported on NVIDIA ethernet switches. Cumulus VX contains all of the software features as Cumulus Linux but provided in a VM format. Cumulus VX provides full data plane functionality via the Linux kernel as well as layer 2 VLANs and both VXLAN bridging and VXLAN routing capabilities. Some functionality is supported in Cumulus VX but not no ethernet switches, due to hardware limitations. Some features are not supported on Cumulus VX due to hardware specific implementations.

| Cumulus VX | Cumulus Linux |
| -----------| ------------- |
| {{< img src="/images/cumulus-vx/cumulus-vx.png" width="450" >}}| {{< img src="/images/cumulus-vx/cumulus-linux.png" width="450" >}}|

All software functions like BGP, spanning-tree and SNMP are fully supported, as well as any automation tooling or third-party packages.

The following table outlines the similarities and differences between Cumulus VX and Cumulus Linux:

<sub>1. Marking and remarking is supported in Cumulus VX via kernel and TC commands, but these are not supported the same on Cumulus Linux.</sub>  
<sub>2. ACLs are supported in Cumulus VX via iptables, but the `cl-acltool` command is not supported</sub>  
<sub>3. NAT is supported in Cumulus VX via iptables but not via cl-acltool. Using NAT within Cumulus VX will not be the same as Cumulus Linux</sub>  

## Support Policy

As a Cumulus Linux customer, you can receive formal GSS support for Cumulus VX instances to:

- Test and stage network topologies before deploying to production.
- Analyze, troubleshoot, and correct issues with configurations and software bugs in Cumulus VX that might also apply to Cumulus Linux running on physical devices.
- Analyze, troubleshoot, and correct issues with Cumulus VX if behaving differently than physical devices. This does not apply in scenarios where it is not possible to emulate physical hardware with virtualization.

Cumulus Networks does *not* provide support for:

- Cumulus VX instances used in a production environment.
- Virtualization environments, including installation, setup, and configuration.
- Automation tool playbooks, including creation and troubleshooting.
- Performance or scalability issues related to network traffic running through Cumulus VX instances.

For non-customers, Cumulus VX remains a community-supported product, with no formal support obligations from Cumulus Networks. You can submit questions to the {{<exlink url="https://slack.cumulusnetworks.com/" text="community Slack channel">}} to engage with the wider community.
